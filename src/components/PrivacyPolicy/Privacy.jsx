        We use session cookies to store the secure session and browsing
        preferences of the user. We set a persistent cookie to store your

        Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
        example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign
        a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can
        contain is information you supply (an example of this is when transact
        as a guest or add items to shopping bag). A cookie cannot read data off
        your hard drive.

        <br></br>
